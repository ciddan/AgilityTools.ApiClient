1. Install ruby (http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
2. Install the following gems:
   - rake
   - albacore
   - version_bumper
3. Run rake in /src
4. Build artefacts located in /src/AgilityTools.ApiClient.Adsml.Client/bin/Release

(or just build it in Visual Studio, but where's the fun in that?)
